# Hotel-database-project

This project is the first part of a 3-semester long Databases course and serves as a final project for assessment.

## Overview

The Hotel Database Project focuses on managing and displaying information about hotel reservations, rooms, guests, services, and more. It's an application that provides:

- **Data Entry:** The ability to add data to tables with controlled input.
- **Data Display:** Convenient display of stored information.
- **Reports:** Generation and presentation of reports.

## Technologies Used

In the Hotel Database Project, the following technologies have been utilized:

1. **Python:** The core programming language used for developing the application's logic and functionality.
2. **Tkinter:** A Python library for creating graphical user interfaces (GUI), employed in designing the application's frontend.
3. **PostgreSQL:** A robust open-source relational database management system used for storing and managing the project's database.
4. **SQL:** Structured Query Language is employed for interacting with the PostgreSQL database, including data retrieval, insertion, and manipulation.
5. **psycopg2:** A PostgreSQL adapter for Python, facilitating the connection between the Python application and the PostgreSQL database.
6. **PIL (Pillow):** Python Imaging Library, or its fork Pillow, is used for handling and manipulating images, as well as displaying graphical elements in the GUI.

These technologies collectively contribute to the development of a functional and user-friendly hotel management system.
